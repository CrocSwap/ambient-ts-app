# Instructions for Use

### Dev Mode

Clone the repo and use `yarn start` to run the Ambient UI in development mode.

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in a browser.

Note: Node v16+ is required

### Environmental Variables

Configure your build environment by adding a dotfile (e.g. `.env.local`) with variable definitions to the top level directory before starting the server. Please reference `.gitignore` in the root directory for dotfile naming conventions.

#### Chain IDs

This allows the app to interface with different networks as defined in the SDK (not all deployments support all networks).

Format: `VITE_CHAIN_IDS=0x1,0x82750,0x5`

Notes:
  * `0x1` → Ethereum Mainnet
  * `0x82750` → Scroll (Ethereum L2 ZK Rollup)
  * `0x5` → Görli Testnet

#### Infura

This is a key for the Infura API which is used to pull metadata from on-chain.

Format: `VITE_INFURA_KEY=*********************`

Notes:
  * Please use your own Infura key for development purposes.
