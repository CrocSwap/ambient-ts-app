#### Coding Style Checklist

Please follow these items as close to as possible for your PR. Please add a description or link a Git issue for context. Check off relevant items and remove as not needed. These will help your reviewer find similar ground for starting their review from. 

- [ ] Does the code stick to our formatting and code standards? Does running prettier and ESLint over the code yield no warnings or errors?
- [ ] Are we using comments correctly? Use /* */ for block comments for new functions.
- [ ] Does this PR have a linked GitHub issue or a short description for context above?
- [ ] Does the change re-implement code that would be better served by pulling an existing module instead?
- [ ] Are we using instances of other classes where possible? 
- [ ] Does TypeScript code compile without raising linting errors?
- [ ] Instead of using raw strings, are constants used in the main class? Or if these strings are used across files/classes, is there a static class for the constants?
- [ ] Are magic numbers declared as constants with an explicit variable name explaining their purpose? 
- [ ] If there is an asynchronous method, does the name of the method end with the Async suffix?
- [ ] Is a minimum level of logging in place? Is the logging level is the right one?
- [ ] Are unit tests used where possible? In most cases, tests should be present for APIs, interfaces with data access, transformation, backend elements and models, with the Arrange/Act/Assert pattern and documentation.
- [ ] Checked against an interface via the implements keyword?
- [ ] Are we passing any new data correctly? Use property passing when data is only needed by child components. If it is needed by multiple components across the app, or if it passing through multiple levels of child components, use Context API.
