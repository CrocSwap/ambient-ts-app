IMPORTANT!

The data in this directory is used by opinionated processes in the app. To work properly, files must be named in the format of SYMBOL.svg (or other image file extension types). The filename, agnostic of extension, must also correspond to a matching filename in the directory `/src/utils/data/tokens` which must be structured consistently with the other files in that directory.
