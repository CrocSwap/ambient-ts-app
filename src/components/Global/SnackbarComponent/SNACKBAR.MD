# Introduction

This directory contains code to create snackbars in the Ambient app and data to fill out the snackbar skeleton.

The snackbar component makes use of two components from MaterialUi. `Snackbar` and `Alert`. The `Alert` component is responsible for rendering a different variant message based on success rate and the `Snackbar` component is responsible for displaying the snackbar itself.

To read more on the component, see the official docs: 
Snackbar : https://mui.com/material-ui/react-snackbar/
Alert: https://mui.com/material-ui/react-alert/

# Developer Notes
