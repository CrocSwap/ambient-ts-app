                    <p>
                        The Interface provides a web or mobile-based means of
                        access to a decentralized protocol on various public
                        blockchains, including but not limited to Ethereum, that
                        allows users to trade certain compatible digital assets
                        (the&nbsp; “
                        <span style={{ fontWeight: 'bold' }}>Protocol</span>”).
                        The Interface may also provide information and data
                        about digital assets or tokens.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The Interface is distinct from the Protocol and is one,
                        but not the exclusive, means of accessing the Protocol.
                        The Protocol comprises open-source or source- available
                        self-executing smart contracts that are deployed on
                        various public blockchains, such as the Ethereum
                        blockchain. Crocodile Labs does not control or operate
                        any version of the Protocol on any blockchain network.
                        By using the Interface, you understand that you are not
                        buying or selling digital assets from us and that we do
                        not operate any liquidity pools on the Protocol or
                        control trade execution on the Protocol. When traders
                        pay fees for trades, those fees accrue to liquidity
                        providers for the Protocol. Crocodile Labs is not a
                        liquidity provider into Protocol liquidity pools and
                        liquidity providers are independent third parties.
                        Deployments on other networks typically make use of
                        cross-chain bridges, which allow assets native to one
                        blockchain to be transferred to another blockchain.

                        good‐faith calculation of the amount in controversy in

                        Such counsel must also sign the Request. By signing the

                        needlessly increase the cost of dispute resolution; (2)

                        warranted by existing law or by a nonfrivolous argument

                        for establishing new law; and (3) the factual and
                        damages contentions have evidentiary support or, if
                        specifically so identified, will likely have evidentiary
