                        We are headquartered in the United States and may use
                        service providers that operate in other countries. Your
                        personal information may be transferred to the United
                        States or other locations where privacy laws may not be
                        as protective as those in your state, province, or
                        country.&nbsp;{' '}

                        The Service is not intended for use by anyone under 16
                        years of age. If you are a parent or guardian of a child
                        from whom you believe we have collected personal
                        information in a manner prohibited by law, please
                        contact us. If we learn that we have collected personal
                        information through the Service from a child without the
                        consent of the child’s parent or guardian as required by
                        law, we will comply with applicable legal requirements
                        to delete the information.

                        appropriate means. Any modifications to this Privacy
                        Policy will be effective upon our posting the modified
                        version (or as otherwise indicated at the time of

                        the effective date of any modified Privacy Policy
                        indicates your acknowledging that the modified Privacy
